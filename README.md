# Sahanur Asif Sizan- Portfolio
## About
I’m Sizan, currently completing my Bachelor degree in Accounting. I also have a strong analytical background in data science, which has helped me build a solid foundation in data calculation. I’m passionate about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights, and I’m excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in the data science field as an entry-level data specialist.

Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends in complex data sets. Additionally, I have gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, statistical analysis, and am also proficient in data analysis tools such as Power BI, QuickBooks, and am learning German for broader international engagement.

In my free time, I’m always exploring new data analysis tools and techniques to further my knowledge. The thrill of discovering new insights and solving complex problems drives me, and I enjoy both team collaborations and independent work.
